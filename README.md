Employee Attrition is defined as the natural process by which employees leave the workforce – for example, through resignation for personal reasons or retirement – and are not immediately replaced.

<h2>Business Importance:</h2> 
Analysing and Detecting various factors that can lead to discontinuing of the employee can help the management to get control on or stopping of such activities hence ensuring that the employees continue to stay with the orgranization, and helps the HR's and managers to manage the workforce. 
Using Data Science Techniques, we analyze the data for trends and generate insights that can help to the management to identify the potential factors that are responsible for employee attrition

<h2>Project Workflow: </h2>
The whole project follows the following Methodology as:

1. Data Exploration
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Train-Test Splitting
5. Model Training and Analysis
6. Feature Selection and reiteration.
7. Results and Conclusion

Various models were being trained during the course of the project and were being analysed in order to choose the optimal one for further use
